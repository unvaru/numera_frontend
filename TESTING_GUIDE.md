# Question Components Testing Guide

## üìö Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing all question components in the Numera accounting learning platform.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Component Testing Page (Recommended)
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/app/test-questions`
3. Use the sidebar to switch between different question types
4. Interact with each component to test functionality

### Option 2: Direct Component Testing
Import and test individual components in your own test files.

  - Balance checking for Balance Sheets
  - Account grouping by statement sections
  - Responsive table layouts

### 7. **Scenario Question** (`ScenarioQuestion.vue`)

## üîß Development Testing

### Browser Console Testing
All components log their answers to the console. Open developer tools and check:
```javascript
// Console output example
{
  questionId: 'mcq-1',
  questionType: 'mcq',
  selectedOptions: ['B'],
  timestamp: '2023-12-07T10:30:00.000Z'
}
```

### Export Test Results
Use the "Export Results" button on the test page to download a JSON file with all test interactions:
```json
[
  {
    "questionId": "mcq-1",
    "questionType": "mcq",
    "answer": { "selectedOptions": ["B"] },
    "timestamp": "2023-12-07T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### Component Props Testing
Test different prop combinations:
```vue
<MCQQuestion
  :question="testQuestion"
  :disabled="false"
  :show-result="false"
  @answer="handleAnswer"
  @next="handleNext"
/>
```

## üì± Mobile Testing Guidelines

### Essential Mobile Tests:
1. **Navigation**: Swipe/scroll navigation works smoothly
2. **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements are easily tappable
3. **Text Readability**: Font sizes scale appropriately
4. **Input Fields**: Virtual keyboard doesn't obscure content
5. **Layout**: No horizontal scrolling required
6. **Performance**: Smooth animations and transitions

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (md/lg)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (xl)

## üêõ Common Issues to Test

### Input Validation:
- Empty submissions
- Invalid number formats
- Special characters in text fields
- Extremely long text inputs

### State Management:
- Answer persistence when navigating between questions
- Component resets after submission
- Disabled state behavior

### Performance:
- Large question sets (20+ options)
- Complex financial statements
- Multiple scenario tasks

## üìä Test Data Variations

The test page includes realistic accounting scenarios:
- **Basic Level**: Fundamental concepts, simple calculations
- **Intermediate Level**: Application problems, multi-step processes  
- **Advanced Level**: Complex scenarios, integrated problems

## üéØ Success Criteria

A component passes testing when:
- ‚úÖ All user interactions work as expected
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback is clear and immediate
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness is seamless
- ‚úÖ Answer data is captured correctly
- ‚úÖ Accessibility standards are met
- ‚úÖ Performance is smooth across devices

## üöÄ Production Readiness

Before deploying:
1. Remove the "Test Questions" link from navigation
2. Delete or secure the test route
3. Verify all console.log statements are removed
4. Test with real question data from your backend
5. Validate all TypeScript interfaces match your API
